              Color: I'm a silver Lab, registered as a Chocolate, because my color is controversial. Some say I must be part Weimeraner, but that hasn't been proven. I do have the dilute gene, bb, which lightens my eyes and coat.

            <p>I'm a lively dog who loves to run and retrieve. I won't chew on shoes, but all Frisbees must die! I'm usually very well behaved, but have been known to neatly abscond with all the bacon or pancakes, except one (maybe you won't notice you didn't eat the rest).        
            </p>
                <p>I am a trained hunting dog from a long line of chanpions. I'll dash through the brush or swim out to the center of a lake to retrieve your duck. It won't have a single tooth mark either. I have a "soft" mouth, which means I won't bite down, or eat the duck myself. That's very tempting, though!</p>
